I am _Rememgram_, your friendly reminder bot.
You can create new reminders with /start. To spare group chats from becoming messy you can create an reminder in a private chat with me and send it to another chat via custom button.
You can even change fast to private chat from any chat you want, if you type _'@rememgram_\__bot '_ and choose _'Create new date for this group!'_.

*Types of events*
There are 4 different types of events you can choose.
*Unique*:  happens just once
*Day*:  always at the same day in each month
*Weekday*:  every nth-occurrence of the chosen weekday
*Fixed period*:  regular with a fixed number of days in between

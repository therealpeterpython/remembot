I am <em>Rememgram</em>, your friendly reminder bot.
You can create new reminders with /start. To spare group chats from becoming messy you can create an reminder in a private chat with me and send it to another chat via custom button.
You can even change fast to private chat from any chat you want, if you type <em>'@rememgram_bot '</em> and choose <em>'Create new date for this group!'</em>.

<b>Types of events</b>
There are 4 different types of events you can choose from:
<b>• Unique</b>:  happens just once
<b>• Day</b>:  always at the same day in each month
<b>• Weekday</b>:  every nth-occurrence of the chosen weekday
<b>• Fixed period</b>:  periodic with a fixed number of days in between
